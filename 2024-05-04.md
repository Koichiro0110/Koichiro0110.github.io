Today, I decided to make a space for my life history. One day, I found my grandpa's random diary who had already passed away, and it was so touching for me. Maybe I shuld do that too. Someday this will become my history. So I will leave a part of it for someone.

This is a WARNING. If you're reading this text, that means you somehow got interested in me, and furthermore, actually might decied to read my writings. I'll be very very honest here. That is the point of this webpage. Therefore, DON'T TELL ME ABOUT THIS EVEN IF YOU READ. I will be very very embarrassed. This is just for myself, because I won't remember everything, but wanna leave some thoughts happened to me, you know?
